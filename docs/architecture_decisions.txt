Frontend microservice will call microservices such as Person and Connection endpoint in order to get and save  the data on the UI.

Location event send  from any user devices and this incoming data can be of large number . Hence, to avoid webapp threads hanging, it is passed through kafka via the link grpc.
This is managed  and passed by the microservice location-event-producer

-> When  the location received, it will process and save into postgresql database.
-> On the consumer end of kafka, it will serviced by location-event-consumer.


As for the person microservice, this endpoint allow person operation, that is to create and retrieve user resource. Connection microservice will retrieve connections of a person.
